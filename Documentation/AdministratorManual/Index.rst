====================

This chapter describes how to manage the extension from a superuser point of view.


Clear Cache
===========

`walls_io_proxy` caches all requested wall posts and containing images. So, if API of walls.io is offline
our extension will deliver the cached wall posts.
As an administrator you can use the `Clear Cache` button (visible on the plugin preview) to clear all
cached wall posts and images.
