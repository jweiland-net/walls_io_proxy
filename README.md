# walls_io_cache

If you use the service of walls.io you accept the use of their Cookies.
In times of GDPR/DSGVO these Cookies may be a problem for you. That's why we
have analyzed their JavaScript and extracted the walls.io requests and adapted
them to PHP. So yes, a Cookie will still be set, but on Server side, not on
Client side. 

As the data is managed through PHP, it's up to you to modify the template on your own now.
